## Functional Specifications

● Users will be able to search for accommodation in the town of their
choosing. The search field is an input field, so users will need to be
able to edit this. This field should be part of a form so that it can be
validated by W3C. The search part does not need to be functional
All maps for accommodation and activities should be entirely
clickable (and not just the title). For the time being the links are
empty. You can use a “href=”#”” attribute to simulate the presence of
a link


- The filters should change appearance during mouseover. Up to us to decide. 


## Technical Specifications

- Two mockups were made: one for desktop and the other a mobile version. The website will also have to be adapted for tablet formats. For Tablets we are free to make our own changes, we need to make sure that no content is cut off. 
- The mockup should be compatible with the latest versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.



### CSS Breakpoints

- 992px for computer screens
- 768px for tablets
- 768 for mobile phones

### Mobile first?

- Design for Desktop first and then use media queries to design for Tabet and Mobile versions

### Image sizes

- Images have come in multiple sizes (X-Large, Large, Medium, Small). Need to decide the appropriate size depending on resolution and loading times. (Lower Res helps with faster loading times, however less clear image).

### Icons

- Use fontawesome 
- The icons come from the Font Awesome library. We could use a CDN to help with the loading of the icons

## Sizing & Units

- The spec asks us to only use FlexBox, PX and %.

## Frameworks

- We have been instructed not to use any framework/preprocessors.

## HTML

- Make sure to use Semantic HTML Tags. 
- Code should be valid according to the W3C HTML and CSS validators.

- "Accomodation and "Activities are links, when clicked they should bring you to their respective sections. “Accommodation in Marseille” and “Activities in Marseille”.
